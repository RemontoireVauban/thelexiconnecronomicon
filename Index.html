                <h6>Author</h6>
                <p class="feature-box-text">Howard Phillips Lovecraft ( August 20, 1890 – March 15, 1937) was an American writer who achieved posthumous
                    fame through his influential works of horror fiction. He was virtually unknown during his lifetime and 
                    published only in pulp magazines before he died in poverty, but he is now regarded as one of the most 
                    significant 20th-century authors of horror and weird fiction.
                    Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his life. Among his most celebrated 
                    tales are The Rats in the Walls, The Call of Cthulhu, At the Mountains of Madness, 
                    The Shadow over Innsmouth, and The Shadow Out of Time, all canonical to the Cthulhu Mythos. 
                    Lovecraft was never able to support himself from earnings as an author and editor, 
                    and he saw commercial success increasingly elude him in his latter period.
                     He subsisted in progressively strained circumstances in his last years; 
                     an inheritance was nearly depleted by the time he died of cancer, at age 46.</p>

            <h6>Genre</h6>
            <p class="feature-box-text">By 1957 Floyd C. Gale of Galaxy Science Fiction said that "like R. E. Howard, Lovecraft seemingly goes on forever;
                 the two decades since their death are as nothing. In any event, they appear more prolific than ever.
                  What with de Camp, Nyberg and Derleth avidly rooting out every scrap of their writings and expanding them 
                  into novels, there may never be an end to their posthumous careers." According to Joyce Carol Oates, Lovecraft 
                  (and Edgar Allan Poe in the 19th century) has exerted "an incalculable influence on succeeding generations of 
                  writers of horror fiction." Horror, fantasy, and science fiction author Stephen King called Lovecraft 
                  "the twentieth century's greatest practitioner of the classic horror tale." King has made it clear in 
                  his semi-autobiographical non-fiction book Danse Macabre that Lovecraft was responsible for his own 
                  fascination with horror and the macabre and was the largest figure to influence his fiction writing.</p>

            <h6>Literary</h6>
            <p class="feature-box-text">Early efforts to revise an established literary view of Lovecraft as an author of 'pulp' were resisted by 
                some eminent critics; in 1945 Edmund Wilson expressed the opinion that "the only real horror in most of 
                these fictions is the horror of bad taste and bad art." But "Mystery and Adventure" columnist Will Cuppy 
                of the New York Herald Tribune recommended to readers a volume of Lovecraft's stories, asserting that 
                "the literature of horror and macabre fantasy belongs with mystery in its broader sense." Gale said that 
                "Lovecraft at his best could build a mood of horror unsurpassed; at his worst, he was laughable.”In 1962 
                Colin Wilson, in his survey of anti-realist trends in fiction The Strength to Dream, cited Lovecraft as 
                one of the pioneers of the "assault on rationality" and included him with M. R. James, H. G. Wells, 
                Aldous Huxley, Tolkien and others as one of the  builders of mythicised realities over against the 
                failing project of literary realism.</p>

            <h6>Philosophical</h6>
            <p class="feature-box-text">Philosopher Graham Harman, seeing Lovecraft as having a unique—though implicit—anti-reductionalist ontology, 
                writes: "No other writer is so perplexed by the gap between objects and the power of language to describe them, 
                or between objects and the qualities they possess." Harman said of leading figures at the initial speculative 
                realism conference (which included philosophers Quentin Meillassoux, Ray Brassier, and Iain Hamilton Grant) that, 
                though they shared no philosophical heroes, all were enthusiastic readers of Lovecraft. Speculative realists, 
                Mark Fisher and other contemporary philosophers, took Lovecraft seriously, mainly because Lovecraft's weird reality 
                as presented in his novels, had nothing to do with the Gothic's insistence in the supernatural, but presented another 
                reality incomprehensible to the human mind, but nonetheless real. According to scholar S. T. Joshi: "There is never 
                an entity in Lovecraft that is not in some fashion material."</p>

                              <h3>Forbidden Knowledge</h3>
                              <p class="ptheme">
                                  Forbidden, dark, esoterically veiled knowledge is a central theme in many of Lovecraft's works. 
                                  Many of his characters are driven by curiosity or scientific endeavor, and in many of his stories 
                                  the knowledge they uncover proves Promethean in nature, either filling the seeker with regret for
                                   what they have learned, destroying them psychologically, or completely destroying the person who 
                                   holds the knowledge. Some critics argue that this theme is a reflection of Lovecraft's contempt 
                                   of the world around him, causing him to search inwardly for knowledge and inspiration.
                              </p>
                              <h3>Fate</h3>
                              <p class="ptheme">
                                  Often in Lovecraft's works the protagonist is not in control of his own actions, or finds it impossible to change course. 
                                  Many of his characters would be free from danger if they simply managed to run away; however, this possibility either never 
                                  arises or is somehow curtailed by some outside force, such as in "The Colour Out of Space" and "The Dreams in the Witch House." 
                                  Often his characters are subject to a compulsive influence from powerful malevolent or indifferent beings. As with the 
                                  inevitability of one's ancestry, eventually even running away, or death itself, provides no safety 
                                  ("The Thing on the Doorstep," "The Outsider," The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, etc.). In some cases,
                                   this doom is manifest in the entirety of humanity, and no escape is possible (The Shadow Out of Time).  </p>
                                <h3>Civilization under threat</h3>
                                <p class="ptheme">
                                  Lovecraft was familiar with the work of the German conservative-revolutionary theorist Oswald Spengler, 
                                  whose pessimistic thesis of the decadence of the modern West formed a crucial element in Lovecraft's overall
                                   anti-modern worldview. Spenglerian imagery of cyclical decay is present in particular in At the Mountains 
                                   of Madness. S. T. Joshi, in H. P. Lovecraft: The Decline of the West, places Spengler at the center of his 
                                   discussion of Lovecraft's political and philosophical ideas. 
                                    Lovecraft wrote to Clark Ashton Smith in 1927: "It is my belief, and was so long before Spengler put his 
                                    seal of scholarly proof on it, that our mechanical and industrial age is one of frank decadence." 
                                    Lovecraft was also acquainted with the writings of another German philosopher of decadence: Friedrich
                                     Nietzsche.
                                    Lovecraft frequently dealt with the idea of civilization struggling against dark, primitive barbarism
                                    . In some stories this struggle is at an individual level; many of his protagonists are cultured, highly
                                     educated men who are gradually corrupted by some obscure and feared influence. 
                                    In such stories, the curse is often a hereditary one, either because of interbreeding with non-humans
                                     (e.g., "Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family" (1920), The Shadow over Innsmouth (1931))
                                      or through direct magical influence (The Case of Charles Dexter Ward). Physical and mental degradation
                                       often come together; this theme of 'tainted blood' may represent concerns relating to Lovecraft's
                                        own family history, particularly the death of his father due to what Lovecraft must have suspected 
                                        to be a syphilitic disorder. 
                                    In other tales, an entire society is threatened by barbarism. Sometimes the barbarism comes as an 
                                    external threat, with a civilized race destroyed in war (e.g., "Polaris"). Sometimes, an isolated 
                                    pocket of humanity falls into decadence and atavism of its own accord (e.g., "The Lurking Fear"). 
                                    But most often, such stories involve a civilized culture being gradually undermined by a malevolent 
                                    underclass influenced by inhuman forces. 
                                    It is likely that the "Roaring Twenties" left Lovecraft disillusioned as he was still obscure and 
                                    struggling with the basic necessities of daily life, combined with seeing non-Western European 
                                    immigrants in New York City.   </p>

                                  <h3>Race, ethnicity, and class</h3>
                                  <p class="ptheme">
                                      Race is the most controversial aspect of Lovecraft's legacy, expressed in many disparaging remarks 
                                      against the various non-Anglo-Saxon races and cultures in his work. As he grew older, his original 
                                      Anglo-Saxon racial worldview softened into a classism or elitism which regarded the superior race to 
                                      include all those self-ennobled through high culture. From the start, Lovecraft did not hold all 
                                      white people in uniform high regard, but rather esteemed the English people and those of English 
                                      descent. He praised non-WASP groups such as Hispanics and Jews; however his private writings on 
                                      groups such as Irish Catholics, German immigrants and African-Americans were consistently negative.
                                       In an early poem, the 1912 "On the Creation of Niggers," Lovecraft describes black people not as 
                                       human but as "beast[s] ... in semi-human figure, filled ... with vice." In his early published essays,
                                        private letters and personal utterances, he argued for a strong color line to preserve race and culture.
                                         He made these arguments by direct disparagement of various races in his journalism and letters, 
                                         and perhaps allegorically in his fiction concerning non-human races. Some have interpreted his
                                          racial attitude as being more cultural than brutally biological: Lovecraft showed sympathy to
                                           those who adopted Western culture, even to the extent of marrying a Jewish woman whom he 
                                           viewed as "well assimilated." While Lovecraft's racial attitude has been seen as directly
                                           influenced by the society of his day, especially the New England society

                                  <p class="ptheme">
                                      At the turn of the 20th century, humanity's increased reliance upon science was both opening new worlds and 
                                      solidifying understanding of ours. Lovecraft portrays this potential for a growing gap of man's understanding 
                                      of the universe as a potential for horror, most notably in "The Colour Out of Space," where the inability of 
                                      science to comprehend a contaminated meteorite leads to horror. 
                                      In a letter to James F. Morton in 1923, Lovecraft specifically pointed to Einstein's theory on relativity as
                                       throwing the world into chaos and making the cosmos a jest; in a letter to Woodburn Harris in 1929, he
                                       speculated that technological comforts risk the collapse of science. Indeed, at a time when men viewed 
                                       science as limitless and powerful, Lovecraft imagined alternative potential and fearful outcomes. In 
                                       "The Call of Cthulhu," Lovecraft's characters encounter architecture which is "abnormal, non-Euclidean, 
                                       and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours." Non-Euclidean geometry is the 
                                       mathematical language and background of Einstein's general theory of relativity, and Lovecraft references 
                                       it repeatedly in exploring alien archaeology. </p>
                                       
                                       <h3>Non-human influences on humanity</h3>
                              <p class="ptheme">
                                  The beings of Lovecraft's mythos often have human servants; Cthulhu, for instance, is worshiped under
                                   various names by cults among both the Greenlandic Inuit and voodoo circles of Louisiana, and in many 
                                   other parts of the world. These worshippers served a useful narrative purpose for Lovecraft. 
                                   Many beings of the Mythos were too powerful to be defeated by human opponents, and so horrific 
                                   that direct knowledge of them meant insanity for the victim. When dealing with such beings, 
                                   Lovecraft needed a way to provide exposition and build tension without bringing the story to
                                    a premature end. Human followers gave him a way to reveal information about their "gods" in
                                     a diluted form, and also made it possible for his protagonists to win paltry victories. 
                                     Lovecraft, like his contemporaries, envisioned "savages" as closer to supernatural knowledge
                                      unknown to civilized man.  </p>

        <section class="mythos">
          <a name="mythos">
            <p class="myth1"></p>The Cthulhu Mythos is a shared fictional universe, originating in the works of American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. 
              The term was coined by August Derleth, a contemporary correspondent and protégé of Lovecraft, to identify the settings,
               tropes, and lore that were employed by Lovecraft and his literary successors. The name Cthulhu derives from the central
                creature in Lovecraft's seminal short story, "The Call of Cthulhu", first published in the pulp magazine Weird Tales
                 in 1928.</p>

            <p class="myth2">An ongoing theme in Lovecraft's work is the complete irrelevance of mankind in the face of the cosmic horrors that 
              apparently exist in the universe. Lovecraft made frequent references to the "Great Old Ones", a loose pantheon of 
              ancient, powerful deities from space who once ruled the Earth and have since fallen into a deathlike sleep.
               While these monstrous deities have been present in almost all of Lovecraft's published work 
               (his second short story "Dagon," published in 1919, is considered the start of the mythos), 
               the first story to really expand the pantheon of Great Old Ones and its themes is "The Call of Cthulhu," 
               which was published in 1928.
            </p>
            <p class="myth3">Lovecraft broke with other pulp writers of the time by having his main characters' minds deteriorate when 
               afforded a glimpse of what exists outside their perceived reality. He emphasized the point by stating in the 
               opening sentence of the story that "The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the
               human mind to correlate all its contents."
            </p>
            <p class="myth4">Writer Dirk W. Mosig notes that Lovecraft was a "mechanistic materialist" who embraced the philosophy of cosmic 
              indifference (Cosmicism). Lovecraft believed in a purposeless, mechanical, and uncaring universe. Human beings, 
              with their limited faculties, can never fully understand this universe, and the cognitive dissonance caused by this 
              revelation leads to insanity, in his view. This perspective made no allowance for religious belief which could not
               be supported scientifically, with the incomprehensible, cosmic forces of his tales having as little regard for 
               humanity as humans have for insects.
            </p>
            <p class="myth5">The view that there was no rigid structure is expounded upon by S. T. Joshi, who said "Lovecraft's imaginary 
              cosmogony was never a static system but rather a sort of aesthetic construct that remained ever adaptable to its 
              creator's developing personality and altering interests. There was never a rigid system that might be 
              posthumously appropriated. The essence of the mythos lies not in a pantheon of imaginary deities nor in a
               cobwebby collection of forgotten tomes, but rather in a certain convincing cosmic attitude."</p>
