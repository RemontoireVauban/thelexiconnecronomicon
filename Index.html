                <p class="feature-box-text">Howard Phillips Lovecraft ( August 20, 1890 – March 15, 1937) was an American writer who achieved posthumous
                    fame through his influential works of horror fiction. He was virtually unknown during his lifetime and 
                    published only in pulp magazines before he died in poverty, but he is now regarded as one of the most 
                    significant 20th-century authors of horror and weird fiction.
                    Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his life. Among his most celebrated 
                    tales are The Rats in the Walls, The Call of Cthulhu, At the Mountains of Madness, 
                    The Shadow over Innsmouth, and The Shadow Out of Time, all canonical to the Cthulhu Mythos. 
                    Lovecraft was never able to support himself from earnings as an author and editor, 
                    and he saw commercial success increasingly elude him in his latter period.
                     He subsisted in progressively strained circumstances in his last years; 
                     an inheritance was nearly depleted by the time he died of cancer, at age 46.</p>

            <h4></h4>
            <p class="feature-box-text">By 1957 Floyd C. Gale of Galaxy Science Fiction said that "like R. E. Howard, Lovecraft seemingly goes on forever;
                 the two decades since their death are as nothing. In any event, they appear more prolific than ever.
                  What with de Camp, Nyberg and Derleth avidly rooting out every scrap of their writings and expanding them 
                  into novels, there may never be an end to their posthumous careers." According to Joyce Carol Oates, Lovecraft 
                  (and Edgar Allan Poe in the 19th century) has exerted "an incalculable influence on succeeding generations of 
                  writers of horror fiction." Horror, fantasy, and science fiction author Stephen King called Lovecraft 
                  "the twentieth century's greatest practitioner of the classic horror tale." King has made it clear in 
                  his semi-autobiographical non-fiction book Danse Macabre that Lovecraft was responsible for his own 
                  fascination with horror and the macabre and was the largest figure to influence his fiction writing.</p>

            <h4></h4>
            <p class="feature-box-text">Early efforts to revise an established literary view of Lovecraft as an author of 'pulp' were resisted by 
                some eminent critics; in 1945 Edmund Wilson expressed the opinion that "the only real horror in most of 
                these fictions is the horror of bad taste and bad art." But "Mystery and Adventure" columnist Will Cuppy 
                of the New York Herald Tribune recommended to readers a volume of Lovecraft's stories, asserting that 
                "the literature of horror and macabre fantasy belongs with mystery in its broader sense." Gale said that 
                "Lovecraft at his best could build a mood of horror unsurpassed; at his worst, he was laughable.”In 1962 
                Colin Wilson, in his survey of anti-realist trends in fiction The Strength to Dream, cited Lovecraft as 
                one of the pioneers of the "assault on rationality" and included him with M. R. James, H. G. Wells, 
                Aldous Huxley, Tolkien and others as one of the  builders of mythicised realities over against the 
                failing project of literary realism.</p>

            <div class="feature-box">
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="feature-box-text">Philosopher Graham Harman, seeing Lovecraft as having a unique—though implicit—anti-reductionalist ontology, 
                writes: "No other writer is so perplexed by the gap between objects and the power of language to describe them, 
                or between objects and the qualities they possess." Harman said of leading figures at the initial speculative 
                realism conference (which included philosophers Quentin Meillassoux, Ray Brassier, and Iain Hamilton Grant) that, 
                though they shared no philosophical heroes, all were enthusiastic readers of Lovecraft. Speculative realists, 
                Mark Fisher and other contemporary philosophers, took Lovecraft seriously, mainly because Lovecraft's weird reality 
                as presented in his novels, had nothing to do with the Gothic's insistence in the supernatural, but presented another 
                reality incomprehensible to the human mind, but nonetheless real. According to scholar S. T. Joshi: "There is never 
                an entity in Lovecraft that is not in some fashion material."</p>
